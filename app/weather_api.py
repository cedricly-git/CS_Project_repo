# --- Weather Feature Extraction ---
# This module provides functions to fetch and process weather data from the Meteomatics API.
# It includes functions to geocode city names to latitude and longitude, and to retrieve weekly rainfall data for a given location.
# We use the output of this feature in "app.py" to have access to the weather data for the selected city.
# The data is used for watering recommendations.
